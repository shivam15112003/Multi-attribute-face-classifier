##üß† Methodology: Multi-Task Image Classification & Regression with Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

##1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective
-------------
To develop a deep learning system that predicts multiple human attributes from images using transfer learning and fine-tuning. The model can handle:
- Age prediction (regression)
- Nationality classification
- Dress code classification

##2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preparation
----------------------------------

Dataset Structure:
- dataset/age/ (folders named by age labels: 10/, 20/, 30/ etc.)
- dataset/nationality/ (subfolders: African/, American/, Australian/, Brazilian/, Indian/)
- dataset/dresscode/ (subfolders: Casual/, Formal/, Semi-formal/)

Preprocessing:
- Image resizing to 224x224 pixels.
- Rescaling pixel values between 0 and 1 (normalization).
- Data augmentation using random flipping, brightness and contrast variations.
- Validation split: 20%

##3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architectures
------------------------

1. Age Prediction Model (Regression)
- Base Model: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Custom Layers:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense(128 units, ReLU)
  - Dropout(30%)
  - Output Layer: Dense(1 unit, Linear activation)
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

2. Nationality Classification Model (Classification)
- Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Custom Layers:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dense(256 units, ReLU)
  - Dropout(50%)
  - Output Layer: Softmax with 5 output classes
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metric: Accuracy

3. Dress Code Classification Model (Classification)
- Same architecture as nationality model
- Softmax with 3 output classes

##4Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning Strategy
--------------------------------------------

Transfer Learning Phase:
- Load pretrained weights from ImageNet.
- Freeze all base model layers (trainable=False).
- Train only the new top layers.

Fine-Tuning Phase:
- Unfreeze selected deeper layers:
  - Last 5 layers for VGG16 (Age model)
  - Last 10 layers for MobileNetV2 (Nationality and Dress Code)
- Use smaller learning rate (1e-5) for fine-tuning to adjust pretrained features.

##5Ô∏è‚É£ Training Details
---------------------

- Optimizer: Adam
- Initial learning rate: 0.0001 (transfer learning), 0.00001 (fine-tuning)
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: 10 (transfer learning) + 5 (fine-tuning)
- Callbacks used:
  - EarlyStopping (patience=5)
  - ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=3)

##6Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics
-----------------------

- Age Model: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Nationality Model: Classification Accuracy
- Dress Code Model: Classification Accuracy

##7Ô∏è‚É£ Integration (GUI - Optional Future Scope)
----------------------------------------------

- Models can be integrated into a desktop application using Tkinter GUI.
- Users can upload an image and get predictions for age, nationality, and dress code in real-time.

##8Ô∏è‚É£ Summary
------------

- All models trained fully inside the same Python code.
- Transfer learning + fine-tuning ensures efficient learning with limited data.
- Models saved for deployment as .h5 files.
